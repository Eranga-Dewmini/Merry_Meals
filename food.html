      <p><br>
          Food safety is part of our culture at MerryMeal. Our Food Safety team, under the direction of our officers, is responsible for managing food safety in our restaurants. In addition to our internal Food Safety team, we have a Food Safety Advisory Council that is comprised of some of the nation’s foremost food safety authorities. The Food Safety Advisory Council and our Board of Directors oversee our food safety policies and practices to help ensure they’re appropriately designed and implemented.We take seriously the safety of our food throughout our supply chain and kitchens Adhering to food safety and quality standards to prevent health risks that can arise from the handling, preparation, and storage of food is a priority we take very seriously in every aspect of our business from our supply chain to our restaurants.It’s important to distinguish between different types of food safety risks so we can manage and mitigate their impact. All of our restaurants operate under a U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s (FDA) Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points (HACCP) system, by which we identify food safety risks in the system and implement corrective actions when needed. The potential for contamination of food through employee illness is our most critical control point. Our sick leave policy, in which restaurant employees are automatically given three days of sick leave from their first day of employment, is designed to reduce this risk. Crew members are also given a Wellness Check at the beginning of each shift to ensure no sick employee is working.

        <h4>PROTOCOLS FOR HANDLING INGREDIENTS AND SANITIZING SURFACES IN OUR KITCHENS  </h4><p>
        We maintain a clean environment in our restaurants and employ safe food handling practices. In 2018, we enhanced our already strong sanitation and HACCP systems designed to ensure restaurant sanitization and food preparation practices. The HACCP systems identify the critical processes that must be controlled and monitored in order to ensure food safety. The senior manager on duty during each shift is designated the Food Safety Leader and is responsible for checking that all food safety procedures are carefully followed. In each restaurant, the Food Safety Leader monitors the daily HACCP logs across 13 critical control points to provide consistent data collection and the greatest possible assurance of our food’s safety. These enhanced procedures help to ensure any pathogens are eliminated in our restaurants, and that the restaurants themselves do not become a source of contamination. Moreover, we employ robust food safety procedures when it comes to cleaning and sanitization. In 2018, we also introduced and fully implemented the Purell Handcare and Surface Sanitation program. We use a natural treatment that reduces many harmful bacteria and viruses from the restaurant environment.

      <h2>Our Food Standards</h2>
      <p>The continuing pandemic has maintained a strong pressure on the food supply chain to adjust their practices and adapt their standards to access to goods. Although the food industry is mature and experienced in food safety, this last two years have shown the needs to innovate to ensure the entire value chain is fully on boarded in food safety practices but also to elevate the add values of the food safety system to ensure continuous improvements.

        There are gaps of maturity which need to be closed by new solutions supporting the industry to improve food safety. The need for collaborative model is urging stakeholders to align their skills and share knowledges of the food supply chain situation to secure traceability in order to commonly ensure food safety to consumer across the world.Improve your environmental performance with this family of standards.
      Conformity assessment involves a set of processes that show our products, service or system meets the requirements of a standard.h5><p>This is a way of showing outsiders that the organisation has an effective quality management system in place.

      <h4>MANDATORY CERTIFICATIONS AND AWARDS FOR FOOD QUALITY</h4><p>
        We are dedicated to providing our employees the training and support they need to ensure food safety is always a top priority. We require our in-restaurant management teams to be trained and certified in food safety by ServSafe, a specialized, nationally recognized third-party program. ServSafe provides online or in-person courses and exams to all Kitchen Managers, Service Managers, Apprentices, General Managers, and Restaurateurs. Participants learn detailed information about food safety, temperature control, cleaning and sanitizing, cross-contamination control, and safety regulations.

        In addition, we train our Field Leaders (leaders responsible for the operational oversight of 5-10 stores in a given region) in the HACCP system certified by the International HACCP Alliance. All Field Leaders are required to provide evidence that they can create a HACCP plan. 
        
        Each quarter, all restaurant team members receive Quarterly Food Safety Training which covers the Food Safety Seven and the company’s key food safety priorities.  The Food Safety Seven are Chipotle’s “Top 7 Food Safety Things To Remember.” These include: work healthy, work clean, keep produce safe, cook food to correct temperatures, hold hot and cold foods at specified temperatures, maintain sanitary conditions, and call for help when needed.

      <h4>ADVANCED TOOLS THAT ELIMINATE PATHOGENS WHILE MAINTAINING FOOD QUALITY</h4>
      <p>We utilize several advanced technologies in our commissaries and restaurants to improve the safety of our raw ingredients without affecting nutrition or taste.  These technologies are novel methods for preparing foods in a QSR concept, and we are proud that we are able to devote resources to these methods in the name of food safety.  We utilize these technologies at our 2,600 restaurants in the U.S., Canada and Europe

      <h4>ADVANCED ELECTRONIC SYSTEM TO ENHANCE OUR TRACEABILITY PROGRAM</h4>
      <p>
        Our traceability program allows us to identify the menu-item ingredients that have traveled to each restaurant—down to the lot code—from the supplier to each restaurant. We scan every case of refrigerated food in every restaurant delivery.  Our traceability program utilizes an electronic system that allows us to track items across our supply chain. Our suppliers identify each food item we track with a unique Global Trade Item Number (GTIN), and then label each case of ingredients with a barcode containing the GTIN, lot number, and pack date or use-by date. As cases of food move from the supplier to our distribution centers, then on to our restaurants, employees scan the barcoded labels. This process allows us to trace an individual lot through the supply chain – all the way to our restaurants. Chipotle is among the first major restaurants in the U.S. to digitally track items from supplier to each and every restaurant in this way. Our ability to track our ingredients from supplier to restaurant at the lot code level is a powerful tool supplementing our food safety program. It helps ensure that we are able to research and act on food safety and quality concerns quickly and thoroughly, knowing where particular ingredients are at a given time, as well as where they’ve been.

      <h4>GROUP OF INDUSTRY EXPERTS ADVISING ON AND REVIEWING OUR PROCEDURES</h4>
      <p>
        In order to ensure our food safety program is as robust as possible, it’s critical to supplement our internal expertise with independent external guidance. In 2016, we established the Food Safety Advisory Council comprised of industry-leading food safety experts. By combining our own Food Safety team with an esteemed group of specialists, we’re working to ensure the program will continually evolve and improve.       </p>
