        <strong>Are you looking for a rewarding opportunity to give back to our community members?</strong><br><br>

        <strong>Join the Meals On Wheels volunteer team and help us fight hunger in the Greater Boston area.</strong><br><br>
        
        We have many hands-on volunteer opportunities each week that provide food relief to people in need. Whether it’s packing up food, delivering groceries, or supporting our seasonal markets or farm program, you’ll get to work with good food and help people who need it!<br><br>
        
        <strong>How can you help?</strong>  We need volunteers to help out all our programs so depending on your preferred day there is a program for everyone! The majority of our volunteer opportunities operate out of our distribution center in the Inner Belt area of Somerville, MA.
        
        Meet some of our volunteers and hear about their experiences volunteering with Meals On Wheels

    <div class="acc" style="width:75%">
      <button class="accordion"><i class="fa fa-plus" ></i>  Why Volunteer? </button>
<div class="panel" >
  <p>There are many reasons to volunteer with Meals On Wheels. First, you are giving your time to reduce hunger and food insecurity in your community. But, volunteering may also have a major impact on your own life. Some of our volunteers mentioned they have benefited from their experience by learning more about food justice, gained a sense of purpose, broadened their career options, and some have expanded their social circles and made new friends.<br><br>

    While it is difficult to fully quantify all that our volunteers do, we know that our volunteers supported the delivery of over 6 million pounds of food in 2020. Our volunteer hours totaled 10,000 hours! That’s worth $200,000 for one individual working at an hourly rate of $20. We thank you for your dedication and commitment!</p>
</div><hr>

<button class="accordion"><i class="fa fa-plus" ></i>  Do I need to attend a training session before my shift?</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>LIt depends on the program you want to volunteer in. Starting Nov 2021, all new Just Eats volunteers must attend an on-site training at our Somerville location after their initial onboarding call and before signing up for shifts. This is due to recently updated safety protocols, and while required for Just Eats, it is optional for volunteers of other programs.</p>
</div><hr>

<button class="accordion"><i class="fa fa-plus" ></i>  What skills are required to volunteer at Meals On Wheels? </button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>Most of the volunteer roles for our programs just require a willingness to learn and interest to help. We have a few specialized positions that require driving, customer service skills, or repeated lifting. Unless otherwise noted, you will be trained on-site on your first day volunteering. Our Volunteer Manager will connect you with the program that best fits your skills and interests.</p>
</div><hr>

<button class="accordion"><i class="fa fa-plus" ></i>  Are there group volunteering opportunities? </button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>We do offer group volunteering opportunities; the team lead should fill out the volunteer form on our website indicating this is for a group or send an email to volunteers@merrymeal.org. Opportunities depend on the group size, timing, and program availability.</p>
</div><hr>

<button class="accordion"><i class="fa fa-plus" ></i>  Do I have to pay to volunteer? </button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>Individual volunteers are not required to pay to participate in our volunteer programs. We could never do what we do without our committed volunteers so your time is invaluable!<br><br>

    If you are affiliated with a corporate group, Meals On Wheels asks that corporations consider supporting the work we do by making a financial donation of a minimum of $75 per employee when they volunteer with us. Donate here! Many other non-profits in the Greater Boston area do this since it takes extra staff time and energy to set these experiences up. Companies often have funding set aside for team-building, and volunteer experiences can be a big benefit to your team and organization overall.<br><br>
    
    If an organization isn’t able to donate, that’s not a bar to volunteering with us- But we hope that you recognize the value of our arranging a group experience and that you’ll consider supporting our organization!<br><br><br>

<button class="accordion"><i class="fa fa-plus" ></i>  Can I volunteer with my friends or family? </button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>You can volunteer with friends or family. However, they must also fill out the interest form on our website & go through the onboarding process to register as an individual volunteer!</p>
</div><hr>

<button class="accordion"><i class="fa fa-plus" ></i>  Where are the volunteering sites located?</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>All volunteer shifts for Just Eats, Weekend Backpack,  and Home Delivery Programs are run out of our distribution center in the Inner Belt area of Somerville. There is street parking nearby, as well as ample bike parking. The Volunteer Manager will inform you of the exact locations on the onboarding call.</p>
</div><hr>

<button class="accordion"><i class="fa fa-plus" ></i>  I’m under 18, can I volunteer at Meals On Wheels?</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>While most of our programs are geared towards adult volunteers (18+), individual teen volunteers are welcomed to help in many program areas after submitting a parent/guardian consent form. Volunteers under 15 years old need to be accompanied by an adult during their volunteer shift. Contact volunteer@merrymeal.org to take the next steps in either of these situations.</p>
