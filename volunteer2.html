          <h4>“My volunteering with Meals On Wheels started back 2021 (during my sophomore year of high school) as part of the Weekend Backpack program – worked with FFF to open a food pantry in my high school. After college I started volunteering with the Home Delivery, Family Meals and later Just Eats programs starting in 2018. Sadly, I’ve not had a most memorable volunteer accomplishment yet but I still want to continue and maybe have one of those golden moments that people talk about. "</h4><br><br>
          <h2>Volunteer Experiences</h2>
          <p>I have been volunteering since the UKG years I would say, even without the formalities of much more structured voluntary organizations. Because, even if you volunteer to be on stage representing your baby class mates at a concert, even if it is a tiniest deed, would be a giant leap in your career one day, and most importantly gifting you the self-satisfaction you would love to feel, being a role model to your colleagues. UKG years and primary school days vanished at a glimpse with lots of volunteering on my own self, but everything fell into right place when I decided to join Interact Club and also embarked my journey as a member of the Girl Guides' Association and the St John's Ambulance Brigade. Life went on, with thousands of volunteering experiences from helping my classmates in difficult subjects to working in more formal and properly structured non profit organizations. Horizons of opportunities broadened, when I joined my college; KDU where I got more prospects of volunteering with Rotaract Club and several other University Clubs & societies. Thus, I would rather say that I have an overall of almost 18 years of volunteering experiences, even if it seems juvenile!</p><br><br>

          <h2>Reason For Joned To MerryMeal</h2>
          <p>From when I was a kid, I was raised with the virtue of being the best version of me and helping people without expecting anything in return. Growing up, I found out that my passion is volunteering for the good course, empowering the underprivileged, in their journey to achieve their goals, which I wouldn't say "achieve their dreams" as dreams are not the reality, but I see the hope, ambition & expectations glowing in their eyes! From being a member of the Interact Club of my school and then a member of the Rotaract Club of my college, to partnering up with individuals, cooperates and a variety of non-profit organizations for humanity, womanhood, children and poverty, volunteering, today, I'm here with the burning hope of helping the rural underprivileged community to gasp the essence of STEM education and technology, to make sure that our future generations are well equipped with the knowledge to surpass the technological barriers and geographical distances.</p>
